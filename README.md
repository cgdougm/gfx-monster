# W3C School's How-To's components

These are a few of the components I saw on [W3C School](https://www.w3schools.com)'s [How-To](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/) and wrote the SvelteJS equivalent.

(More information about [SvelteJS](https://svelte.dev).)

## Motivation

I wanted to learn more about the proper way to construct components.

I'd also like to see the difference between plain vanilla JavaScript components and the Svelte version, as well as other more common frameworks.

## Demo

The project is available at my [Two-dollar domain](http://gfx.monster).

I've used [surge.sh](surge.sh) to deploy.

## Components
